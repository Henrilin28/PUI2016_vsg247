# Assignment 1

For Assignment 1 we had to write a script to access data from the MTA API and then analize the json file in order to find the relevant information. The final goal was to be able get all the current locations of buses of a given line and print them to the terminal. 

# Assignment 2

For Assignment 2, instead of only printing the buses locations we had to make the script write a csv file with the location info, plus the next stop and the status in relation to that stop (at stop, approaching, or < 1 stop away)


# Assignment 3

For this assignment we had to access the Data Facility and write a IPython Note book that would read a csv file from there to a pandas dataframe, so that we could start visualizing that data. 

# Group work

I worked with my roomates Avikal(as10724) and Danny(df1383). I analyzed the json file together with Danny and Avikal helped me figure out how to access the data in it. On Assignment 3, Avikal helped me figure out the correct path to read the csv file from the data facility.
