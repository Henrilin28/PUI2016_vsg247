# Assignment 1

In Assignment 1 we had to analyse 5 different types of distributions and try to visualize the Law of Large Numbers and the Theorem of Central limit for each one of them. 

# Assignment 2

In Assignment 2 we worked on extracting data from the CitiBike website and preparing it for further analyses. 
Besides that, we had to formulate a question in the format of a Null and an Alternative Hypothesis, that we could answer with the Citibike data we collected. 

# Assignment 3

For Assignment 3 we performed a Z-test concerning the effects of the route change of a bus line and had to formulate the problem with a Null and Alternative Hypothesis and interpret the results. 

# Group work

This time I worked mostly on my own but did have some help from Avikal on figuring out how to perform the Z-test and also the discussions on the cohort whatsapp group helped me have a better understanding of the problems on each assignment.
