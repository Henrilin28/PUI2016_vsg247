# Assignment 2

I worked with Richard (rav220) and Adrian (akd361) on fiinding an example of the Chi-square test.
It took us a while to find one where the chi-square test was more clearly stated, but we ended up finding this one. We discussed a little bit about whether the representation in percentages in Figure 4 indicated that the dependent variable was actually continuos, but ended up agreeing that that was not the case.
